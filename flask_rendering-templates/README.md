# TEMPLATE RENDERING

In this topic we learn how render whole templates because lets face it writing html in python is boring.

#### The file system

In the root directory you are to create two folders: 1, the *template* folder and 2, the *static* folder.

The **template** folder will contain the various html files we create. This may include index.html, base.html, user.html, login.html etc etc.

The **static** folder will contain all our js and css.

#### Template design with jinja2

To create the templates we use a tool called jinja two for templating. This allows us to do complex operations on our html files and brings upon the element of being dynamic.

Jinja2 is quite popular it is also used in django as the template designer.
